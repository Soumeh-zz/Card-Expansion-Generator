# Card Expansion Generator

## To-Do

- ~~Local card caching so progress doesn't get lost~~
- Optionally, attach images instead of imageURLs
- ~~Change main function to take a JSON object as an input and generate values using it~~
- Input option
- ~~Reset option, for easily starting anew (with an appropriate warning)~~
- Prettier visuals, to represent how the final images are actually going to look
