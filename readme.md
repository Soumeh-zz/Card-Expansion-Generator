# Card Expansion Generator

## To-Do

- Local card caching so progress doesn't get lost
- Change main function to take a JSON object as an input and generate values using it
- Input option, from JSON string or file
- Reset option, for easily starting anew (with an appropriate warning)
- Prettier visuals, to represent how the final images are actually going to look
- Move to next line on Enter, for an easier time creating cards
