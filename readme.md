# Card Expansion Generator

## To-Do

- ~~Local card caching so progress doesn't get lost~~
- ~~Change main function to take a JSON object as an input and generate values using it~~
- ~~Import option~~
- ~~Reset option, for easily starting anew (with an appropriate warning)~~
- Prettier visuals, to represent how the final cards are actually going to look
- ~~Button for removing specific cards~~
- ~~Optionally, attach images instead of imageURLs~~ this would take way too much effort
